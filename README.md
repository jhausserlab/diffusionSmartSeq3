# Diffusion Smart-seq3 code

To replicate the analysis, execute the sections of the R markdown file findSpatialGenes.Rmd.

To do so, you will need two data files:
- the Smart-seq3xpress data of our MDA-MD-231 spheroids (allCounts.rds)
- the human breast tumor single-cell RNAseq dataset from Wu et al. (wuUMIs.rds)
Both files are hosted at this address:
